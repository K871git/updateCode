#identation in python


# # Error below! Notice a single space at the start of the line

# i = 5
#  print('Value is', i)
# print('I repeat, the value is', i)

# How to indent:
    # Use four spaces for indentation. This is the official Python language recommendation.
    # Good editors will automatically do this for you. Make sure you use a consistent number
    # of spaces for indentation, otherwise your program will not run or will have unexpected
    # behavior.
