#looping in python
#Python does not have built-in functionality to explicitly create a do while loop like other languages. But it is possible to emulate a do while loop in Python
#condition has to be print at once compulsory

#for loop and while loop
#while loop
# i=0
# i=int(input("Enter a number ::"))
# while(i<10):
#     print(i)
#     i=i+1
# print("out of the loop")

#decrement while loop
# cnt=9
# while(cnt>0):
#     print(cnt)
#     cnt=cnt-1

# print("done with the loop")    

h="hello"
h1=""
print("before h1\n")
print("****")
print(h1)
print("****")
print("After h1")

for s in h:
    h1=s

print(h)
